This page serves as a reference to usages of named ID sets used in released mods. The [`Custom and Named ID Sets` Pull Request](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/pull/4381) has more details on how to use and collaborate on named ID sets.

Feel free to update this listing with usages from your released mods. Try to be brief and try to collaborate with other mod makers to agree on keys and their intended "meaning". The sets might represent a concept, not a specific effect implementation. How each mod interacts with the intended meaning of each set is up to each mod. There is no purpose in adding named ID sets to your mod unless other mods intend to collaborate with that set, so try to talk and plan with other modders.

# Named ID Sets
Named ID sets facilitate mod collaboration without requiring mod dependencies. This is referred to as ad-hoc collaboration. Mods can use named ID sets to "tag" content in their mods, and other mods can read and act on those tags.
